preprocess.m // writes new preprocessed images

removeborder.m //removes border 

segmeter2.m //bounding box stuff, returns Character struct of bounding box locations

extract.m //extracts character from bounding box from segmenter2, turns into matrix

synth.m // (in progress) synthetic data creation through linear transformations?

HOG.m // Histogram of Oriented Gradients code

lrCostFunction.m // Computes cost and gradient for logistic regression with regularization

oneVsAll.m  //trains multiple logistic regression classifiers and returns all
             //the classifiers in a matrix all_theta, where the i-th row of

predictOneVsAll.m // Predicts whether the label is 0 or 1 using learned logistic
