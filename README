results.m // does classification, currently reports "Training Set Accuracy: 90.800000"

ex3.m // trains all_theta, one-vs-all classifier ~9 min runtime, has lambda param for regularization

getDataMat.m // makes data_x matrix of samples, data_y matrix of corresponding classes

preprocess.m // writes new preprocessed images

removeborder.m //removes border 

cs155.m // obsolete stuff



lrCostFunction.m // Computes cost and gradient for logistic regression with regularization

oneVsAll.m  //trains multiple logistic regression classifiers and returns all
             //the classifiers in a matrix all_theta, where the i-th row of all_theta 
             //corresponds to the classifier for label i
             // uses fmincg

fmincg.m //crazy minimization function for oneVsAll.m


predictOneVsAll.m // Predicts whether the label is 0 or 1 using learned logistic 
                  // regression parameters all_theta from ex3.m
