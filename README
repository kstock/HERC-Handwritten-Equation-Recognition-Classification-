proto.m  //(in progress, very messy) prototype 

svmResults //classification based on SVM using vlfeat, adapted from a vlfeat example

results.m // does classification using logistic regression

getDataMat.m // takes optional arg and returns data_x matrix of HOG-ified samples, 
             // data_y matrix of corresponding classes

preprocess.m // writes new preprocessed images for all images in a folder

removeborder.m //removes border 

segmeter2.m //bounding box stuff, returns Character struct of bounding box locations

extract.m //extracts character from bounding box from segmenter2, turns into matrix

parse.py //parses a matrix into LaTeX, outputs to .tex file

getClass.m //returns the class of a sample given a filename

makeHoldout.py //takes random subset of data for holdout data

synth.m // (in progress) synthetic data creation through linear transformations?

HOG.m // Histogram of Oriented Gradients code

lrCostFunction.m // Computes cost and gradient for logistic regression with regularization

oneVsAll.m  //trains multiple logistic regression classifiers and returns all
             //the classifiers in a matrix all_theta, where the i-th row of
             //all_theta corresponds to the classifier for label i.
             // uses fmincg

fmincg.m //crazy minimization function for oneVsAll.m


predictOneVsAll.m // Predicts whether the label is 0 or 1 using learned logistic 
                  // regression parameters all_theta from ex3.m
